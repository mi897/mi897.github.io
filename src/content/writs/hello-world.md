    Hello You

    Blinded by the energy you radiate
    Basking in your light, I grow, heal, ameliorate
    Arms I have not to hold
    Yet my life blood defies gravity to approach
    Lost in your sparkle I search for more
    Of your worlds, your wonder
    More of you to explore
    You are my sun, my moon, and all my stars
    Words stolen, for I remain petrified with you pervading my heart
