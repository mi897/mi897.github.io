I believe I just convinced myself that I'm not going to try to go abroad in the next few years. I think a major part of what was stopping me from living a life and doing things I genuinely enjoy now was the fact that I could not make peace with not having moved abroad already. At the moment, I have certain challenges I want to, and feel the need to, take on. Now, I'm not planning on giving my life away for those but I do think I need to stay put here for a while. And while I'm here, I might as well make the most of it. I'll still be working on the dog till I can get it to walk how I want it to. At some point, I will prepare a couple of reports and submit them. If that gets me a degree, great. If not, I'll find other ways to do and make the things I want. I know it seems like I'm putting my life on hold and falling behind, but I don't think that anymore. I'm still growing, learning, and trying to create a life I do not want to escape.
