    of flocks, schools, and boids

    Graphs portray beauty
    Of systems that tend to get bigger and denser
    Whether by edges or vertices they grow,
    The larger the network the better
    Each member as simple as can be,
    Each with facets as few as three
    With strong identity, acting as their own,
    In their bubble, adventurous and bold
    And no deity to rule them true
    Yet complex patterns emerge as so
    Baffled they leave us with more questions in queue
    For all they know are some ones (1) and Os (0)
